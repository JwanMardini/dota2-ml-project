# Dota 2 Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting outcomes in Dota 2 matches using machine learning. It features an end-to-end pipeline, from data preprocessing to deploying a trained model via a backend API and an interactive web interface. The project is hosted online, enabling easy access and usability.

## Dataset Description

The original Dota 2 dataset comes without headers or column names, and many fields use raw IDs that are difficult to interpret. To address this, a preprocessing script (`dota_data_mapper.py`) was created and executed. 

### Preprocessing Steps:
1. **Mapping IDs**: 
   - Hero IDs, cluster IDs, game mode IDs, and game type IDs were mapped to meaningful names using metadata JSON files (`heroes.json`, `regions.json`, `mods.json`, and `lobbies.json`).
2. **Adding Column Names**: 
   - Columns were labeled for clarity, with individual columns for each hero in the match.
3. **Output**: The cleaned datasets (`dota2TrainFixed.csv` and `dota2TestFixed.csv`) are included in the repository.

This preprocessing ensures that the dataset is ready for machine learning tasks, making it easier to interpret and analyze.

## Machine Learning Pipeline

An end-to-end machine learning process is detailed in the `project_work.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, covering the following steps:
1. **Data Exploration**: Insights and visualizations to understand the dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming data into a format suitable for modeling.
3. **Model Training**: Building and evaluating a machine learning model to predict match outcomes.
4. **Model Deployment**: Saving the trained model for integration into a backend service.

The notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to the machine learning process and can be used to reproduce the results.

## Backend API

The trained model is integrated into a FastAPI backend (`ml_api.py`) to provide predictions in real time. The backend:
- Accepts input data in JSON format.
- Processes the input using the trained model.
- Returns predictions to the client.

The backend is hosted on Render, and the source code for the API is available in this repository.

## Frontend Application

The project includes a web-based frontend built with React and Tailwind CSS. The frontend:
- Provides an intuitive interface for interacting with the model.
- Sends requests to the FastAPI backend and displays the results.

The frontend is also hosted on Render and accessible at the [Live Demo](https://machine-learning-frontend.onrender.com).
